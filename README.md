# copilot-ghas-demo

This repository demonstrates the synergy between GitHub Copilot for enhanced developer productivity and GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS) for robust code security in an AI-assisted development workflow.

## What you'll find:

* **Copilot Examples:** Illustrations of how GitHub Copilot assists in code generation and completion.
* **GHAS in Action:** Demonstrations of key GHAS features:
    * **Code Scanning (CodeQL):** Identifying potential security vulnerabilities.
    * **Secret Scanning:** Detecting and preventing the accidental commit of secrets.
    * **Dependabot:** Managing and updating vulnerable dependencies.

## Purpose:

This demo aims to highlight how developers can leverage the speed and efficiency of AI-powered coding assistants like Copilot while maintaining a strong security posture through the integration of tools like GitHub Advanced Security. It underscores the importance of a balanced approach to modern software development, where AI assists but security remains a core responsibility.

## Get Started:

1.  **Fork the Repository:** Click the **Fork** button in the top-right corner.
2.  **Clone Your Fork (Optional):**
    ```bash
    git clone <your_forked_repository_url>
    cd copilot-ghas-demo
    ```
3.  **Run the Application (If Applicable):** *(Refer to specific instructions within the repository if it contains an executable application.)*
4.  **Enable GitHub Actions:** Navigate to the **Actions** tab and explore existing workflows or create new ones in `.github/workflows`.
5.  **Enable GitHub Advanced Security:**
    * Go to **Settings** > **Code security and analysis**.
    * **GitHub Advanced Security:** Click **Enable** (if not already enabled).
    * **Code scanning:** Click **Enable** and configure the scan settings.
    * **Secret scanning:** Ensure it's enabled.
    * **Dependabot:** Ensure **Dependabot version updates** and **Dependabot security updates** are enabled.

## Key Takeaway:

While AI tools like Copilot can significantly boost productivity, integrating security tools like GHAS is crucial for building secure and reliable software. This demo showcases how these technologies can work together effectively.
